%This should be one section and count less than 100 words.
\abstract{For more than 20 years and 50,000 generations, we have evolved 12 
replicate populations of Escherichia coli in the laboratory. This model system
 has immense power to illuminate many basic questions in evolutionary biology.
 In particular, we can examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation in real
 time. From one well-studied line in this long-term evolution experiment, we
 revived bacteria from whole-population samples frozen every 500 generations. 
These samples cover 30,000 generations of evolution. Using Illumina VeraCode 
technology, we genotyped each whole-population sample for 96 alleles of 
evolutionary significance. We observe both the fixation of beneficial alleles 
as well as significant bouts of clonal interference. To examine the diversity 
of genotypes produced under clonal interference, we genotyped 90 clones 
sampled at 7,500 and 10,000 generations. We compare these results to 
population genetic simulations. }
