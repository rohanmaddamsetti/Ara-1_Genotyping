README for Mixed Pop. Sequencing comparison.
Rohan Maddamsetti, 9/26/2011.

SNPs from the Cold Spring Harbor paper supplementary material were saved in an
excel spreadsheet named MixedPopSequencingSNPs.xlsx. This file was then converted
to *.csv format; the 'notes' column was removed from this file, and the headings
were slightly changed so that the data would be more readable when analysed with R.
A perl script called formatMixedPopSequencing.pl was used
to add 'Ara-1-*' prefixes and '*-snp' suffixes to the gene name for each snp.
This was saved as a UTF-8 encoded *.csv file called 
EditedMixedPopSequencingSNPs.csv. This file was then compared by hand to 
a description of the Veracode SNP assays called 
Scored_orders_illumina_com_Lenski_Ara_1_091205.csv, so that the coordinates and the
names of each SNP in both of these files matched up properly. A couple minor errors
were found in each file, which I corrected. I then renamed
EditedMixedPopSequencingSNPs.csv to FinalMixedPopSequencingSNPs.csv.
This file is what R uses as input to do the comparison between mixed pop.
sequencing and the Veracode genotyping results.
