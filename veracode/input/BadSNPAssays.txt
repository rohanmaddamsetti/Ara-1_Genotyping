## BadSNPAssays.txt by Rohan Maddamsetti, 4/18/2011
## This is a list of SNP assays that plainly didn't work across all datasets.
## This decision was based on looking at the averaged plate data
## (currently called finalfudge.pdf), and at the 7.5K and 10K heatmaps.
## NOTE 1: Ara-1-hslU-snp is excluded, but it may have occurred independently
## in both competing clades existing at 10K generations.
## NOTE 2: All rearrangement assays are excluded by default for technical
## reasons.
## NOTE 3: Ara−1−ompF−asnS−snp and Ara−1−ompF−asnS..3−snp assays are excluded.
## There is some evidence of cross-reactivity between these snps.
## There's an unassayed SNP one position away from ompF-asnS..3snp that was found
## in the Cold Spring Harbor Mixed Population Sequencing paper, that might be responsible
## for this observation.
## NOTE4: Ara-1-kup-insJ-5-ins-u is excluded because the specificity of the
## assay is questionable.
